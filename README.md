# Optimization-problem-

 calculating efficient frontier for several values of constraint for expected return, with a minimal value of standard deviation. For values of mean
= 0.01, 0.0125, 0.015, 0.020, 0.025, 0.035 the following graph provides the minimal value of standard deviation. (using MATLAB and Portfolio Safegaurd)
